# MATLAB_PROJECTS
MATLAB implementations of my labwork and personal experiments<br />
This repository contains some of the MATLAB Live Scripts that I've worked on in the past year, most of them are coding and maths experiments inspired by the university courses I attended.
Not being satisfied with the explanations I had received in class and eager to improve my MATLAB skills, I decided that the best course of action would be trying to deconstruct and replicate
the theoretical concepts I was taught.
